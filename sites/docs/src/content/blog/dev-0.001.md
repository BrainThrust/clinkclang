Dev 0.01 is the first version of the ClinkClang Library.

## What's the point of releasing this library with so many agentic frameworks out there?

You can't make serious progress in your A.I applications without owning the actual A.I stack. One of the things we noticed besides UX when building our own A.I applications is that we had to fork a lot of the libraries then edit to make them work with our own A.I stack.

Using this library, you can make progress on your A.I applications faster. If you require to update then all you have to do is `pnpm dlx module or component`. Take only the required changes and you're good to go.
