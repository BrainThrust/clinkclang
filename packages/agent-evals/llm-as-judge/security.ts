    In this scenario, attackers can use a variety of approaches. We will focus on demonstrating what is known as a brute-force dictionary attack. 
    A typical dictionary brute force attack uses password lists, which are large text files containing thousands of common passwords gathered from years of data breaches.
    To simulate our attack, we will use the popular “rockyou.txt” wordlist. But there are all kinds of reputable wordlists, such as the SecLists project, which is maintained by Daniel Miessler, Jason Haddix, and g0tmi1k.
    We will conduct our attacks against the web application of the evil "g4rg4m3l". Let's help the Smurfs. Remember to always hack for good!
    A common username found in all kinds of services and applications is "admin." So that’s the account we’ll try to brute force
